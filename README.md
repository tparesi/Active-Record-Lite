# Active-Record-Lite

In order to understand how Active Record works "under the hood" with SQL, I have created an Active Record Lite that copies major features of Active Record.

Here are the things I recreated:

* Attribute Accessor
* All, Find, Insert, Update, Save
* Searchable (using where)
* belongs_to has_many Associations
* has_one_through
